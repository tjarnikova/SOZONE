    **What observations are there? how are they distributed in space and time? (GLODAPv2.2021)**  
      
    extract only SO points with valid DIC and TA   
      
    **How does DIC, TA, T, S from T001, M001 runs compare?**  
      
    next steps - add model output to dataframes. calculate bias in DIC, TA, s, t,
