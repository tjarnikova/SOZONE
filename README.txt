Where things are in SOZONE:
**EVAL_forcing**
    ----goal is to understand/evaluate the wind forcing for diff. products----
    - Forcing_familiarization.ipynb > code scratchpad
    - Mapping_scratchpad.ipynb > figuring out mapping
    - mapfxn.py > 
    - so_landmask.ipynb > update CLQ landmask for our plotting
    *Folder* make_monthly_SO_forcing
    mostly pyscripts for averaging 
        - simple_landmask.nc > made in Forcing_familiarization.ipynb, 1 is land 0 is water
        - MO_wind_monthly.py > pyscript for averaging winds south of 50
        - runner.ipynb > for running pyscripts (for now)
    *Folder* averaged_forcing
        
**UTILS**
    ---commonly used functions and landmasks
    -mapfxn.py > code for southern ocean mapping
    -sector_landmask > landmask for different sectors, made in so_landmask.ipynb
