The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for sharing of Python code
techniques and notes about model results analysis code.
They were developed by Tereza Jarnikova.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[T001_M001_Hovmol_Compare.ipynb](/RUNS_ANALYSIS//T001_M001_Hovmol_Compare.ipynb)  
    
    **Notebook purpose: Comparing output of TOM12_TJ_T001 and TOM12_TJ_M001**  
      
    - no spinup, years 1948-2020  
    - T001 has CLIO physics and NCEP  
    - M001 has CORE physics and MetOffice/noOzone  
    - rest should be the same  
      
      
    **(very) preliminary notes:**  
    - T001/NCEP fresher accross the board in winter, something strange happens year 2010 or so-possibly an error in copying?  
    - TOO1 saltier in surface in midlatitudes (-60s) in summer? icemelt differences  
    - T001 warmer in northern southern ocean (50s) in both winter and summer  
    - appreciable temperature differences even at 4000m depth!  
    - in both summer & winter, T001 has more DIC at surface but less at depth?

    **Looking at first model run**  
      
    Some questions:  
        - those breakdown files and calculations?  
          
          
    Hi Dave,   
      
        All good over here.   
        -carbon export?
