    Short summaries of notebooks:

* ##[T001_M001_Hovmol_Compare.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/tjarnikova/SOZONE/blob/master/RUNS_ANALYSIS/T001_M001_Hovmol_Compare.ipynb)  
    
    **Notebook purpose: Comparing output of TOM12_TJ_T001 and TOM12_TJ_M001**  
      
    - no spinup, years 1948-2020  
    - T001 has CLIO physics and NCEP  
    - M001 has CORE physics and MetOffice/noOzone  
    - rest should be the same  
      
      
    **(very) preliminary notes:**  
    - T001/NCEP fresher accross the board in winter, something strange happens year 2010 or so-possibly an error in copying?  
    - TOO1 saltier in surface in midlatitudes (-60s) in summer? icemelt differences  
    - T001 warmer in northern southern ocean (50s) in both winter and summer  
    - appreciable temperature differences even at 4000m depth!  
    - in both summer & winter, T001 has more DIC at surface but less at depth?  

* ##[TOM12_TJ_T001_explore.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/tjarnikova/SOZONE/blob/master/RUNS_ANALYSIS/TOM12_TJ_T001_explore.ipynb)  
    
    **Notebook purpose: **  
      
    - Looking at first model run  
    - familiarizing with output, calculating sector-wide averages  


* ##[CarbonContent.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/tjarnikova/SOZONE/blob/master/RUNS_ANALYSIS/CarbonContent.ipynb)  
    
    **Notebook purpose:**  
      
    - compare carbon budget between model T001 and M001 model runs
